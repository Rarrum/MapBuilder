-------- To Do ---------

>-- Remaining for Future:

- IPV6
- maybe: Performance tracking system
- maybe: Network data structure synchronization
- A high level model/mesh system
- Add support for effects extensions to the sound framework.

--------- Done ---------

>-- For 0.5
- Add support for Ogg Opus files. (luke)
- Hmd wrapper for the Oculus Rift. (luke)
- Switch from ImageMagick to FreeImage+FreeType. (luke)

>-- For 0.4
- Add gamepad/joystick support to input (luke)
- Rewrite audio streaming to optionally support cooperative multitasking (luke)
- Unified input system for buttons and axes of all device types.  Persistent identifiers for input objects. (luke)
- Fullscreen mode support for graphics. (luke)

>-- For 0.3:
- A high level sound API based on OpenAL (luke)
- Better way to convey errors during startup/shutdown (luke)
- OpenGL extensions support (lukel)
- OpenGL wrappers for Texture objects ands Vertex/Index Buffer objects. (luke)
- A solution for loading images into textures (luke)
- A solution for rendering text (luke)
- 64-bit support (luke)

>-- For 0.2:
- Simple window management for both platforms (luke)
- Setup for OpenGL on both platforms (luke)
- An input framework - mouse and keyboard only right now (luke)
- Various networking improvements, including basic UPNP support (luke)

>-- For 0.1:
- Basic networking framework (luke)
- Thread Pool (luke)
- Threaded Task Executer (luke)

>-- For 0.0:
- Import a few parts from my old framework (luke)
- Seperate out or remove windows-specific stuff (luke)
- Write linux implementations of windows parts that were seperated out (luke)
- Write thread contructs for both platforms (luke)
- Set up a minimal makefile for g++ compilation on linux (luke)
- Set up a VS project to compile code for windows (luke)
- A set of thread locking and blocking constructs (luke)
- A chainable debug output system (luke)
- A set of functions to retrieve basic system/hardware information (luke)
- File system utilities to create paths and build filenames independently of platform (luke)
- A totally revamped geometry library - basic constructs only (luke)
- Functional tests for most of the existing framework (luke)
- Stack tracing (luke)
- Create HTML documentation for the framework (luke)
